1.Enhancing Ophthalmic Diagnostics: CNNs in Cataract Detection

Published in IEEE, 2024

Cataracts have been one of the most prevalent eye 
disorders, which often can cause significant visual impairment 
due to the clouding of the eye‚Äôs lens. This condition can worsen 
in future, often leading to severe vision problems and even 
blindness. Consequently, detecting cataracts is paramount in 
mitigating the associated risks and preventing the onset of 
blindness. Throughout the years there has been quite good 
progress in leveraging cutting-edge technology, especially due to 
machine learning, to improve the perfection and efficiency of
cataract detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
have made an appearance as a commanding implement for 
computerized the systematization of eye images.
